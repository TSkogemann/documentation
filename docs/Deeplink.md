When an user is clicking the url, the following steps will happen:

1) Check if user is logged, else ask them to login

2) Prompt user that they are about to login to the specific app

3) Check if user has access to the application, else give user access

4) Redirect to application landing page


# Warning 

This link is a direct invite to your app. Everyone with this key will be able to create a user for your NStack application. So be carefull who you send this out to.
